# Work

My project was to create my first portfolio website using only css and html to tell future employers or whoever is curious about me and the work that I have created. The guidelines or requirements for the project included:

My idea was to try and duplicate the look of simple business card that would contain my name and some links that would take the viewer to attached <sections> on the page

This was the first rendition of the lead card that came from the earliest code

Obviously not very appealing, so the buttons were stylized and additional html and css were added

More and more css and html were added to evolve the project..
