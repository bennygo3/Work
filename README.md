# Work

My project was to create my first portfolio website using only css and html to tell future employers or whoever is curious about me and the work that I have created. The guidelines or requirements for the project included:

My idea was to try and duplicate the look of simple business card that would contain my name and some links that would take the viewer to attached <sections> on the page

This was the first rendition of the lead card that came from the earliest code

Obviously not very appealing, so the buttons were stylized and additional html and css were added

More and more css and html were added to evolve the project..

Now for the final step of adding media queries and tinkering with widths and margins to make the project visually appealing and functional for multiple viewports..

The first step was to get rid of the vertical line on the first card that separated my name and links. This would prevent the line from overlapping my name and section links when both of those elements flexed to a column to keep the integrity or look of the (business) card. 

This is what the first card looks like after the viewport shrinks:

The other cards were tidied up and modified to create a finalized product for this project (hopefully)!
